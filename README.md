# CSSE3010 - Embedded Systems Design and Interfacing
The repository contains the stages and project written during enrolment into [CSSE3010](https://csse3010.uqcloud.net/csse3010/) at The university of Queensland.
The project is written in C and is designed to run on the ARM Cortex M4 based Nucleo-F429.
This repository only contains the source code I wrote and not the libraries (provided by the course) required to run the code on the Nucleo-F429.
